"Super Bass"
by Nicki Minaj

this one is for the boys
with the boomin' system

top down ac
with the cooler system
when he come up in the club
he be blazin' up
got stacks on deck like he savin' up

and he ill, he real, he might gotta deal
he pop bottles and he got the right kind of build
he cold he dope he might sell Pepsi
he always in the air but he never fly coach
he a delightful trip, trip 
sailor of the ship, ship 
when he make it drip, drip kiss him on the lip, lip

that's the kinda dude i was lookin' for
and yes you'll get slapped if you're lookin' yo
i said excuse me you're a hell of a guy
i mean my my my my you're like pelican fly
